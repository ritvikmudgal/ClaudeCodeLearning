# Claud Code Learning




## Quick summary

- **Task A** helped me understand the *architecture* behind large models (Claude, GPT, etc.) and how different layers talk to each other.
- **Task B** is where agents came into the picture and they are basically “specialized workers” coordinated by another agent.
- **Task C** introduced tool usage, meaning LLMs aren't just text generators, they can actually call APIs or search stuff.

- **Task E** mixed everything together in a bigger workflow.
- **Task F** was reflection + documentation,
